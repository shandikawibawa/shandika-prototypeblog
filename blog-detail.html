                <h2>Tollways</h2>
                <p>
                  All code has a maintenance cost. Some code of course is an
                  absolute nightmare to maintain. We would say its maintenance
                  cost is high. Other code is easier to maintain. We would say
                  its maintenance cost is low, or at least relatively low
                  compared to worse code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When thinking about good code and bad code, it's worth
                  considering when exactly code's maintenance cost is incurred.
                  We might refer to these events as ‚Äútollways‚Äù. We can't travel
                  these roads without paying a toll.
                </p>
                <p>Tollway 1: when the code is changed</p>
                <p>
                  For any particular piece of code, a toll is incurred every
                  time that code needs to be changed. The size of the toll
                  depends on how easy the code is to understand and change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tollway 2: when the code needs to be understood in order to
                  support a change in a different area
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even if a piece of code doesn't need to be changed, the code
                  incurs a toll whenever someone it needs to be understood in
                  order to make a different change. This dependency of
                  understanding happens when pieces of code are coupled via
                  inheritance, passing values in methods, global variables, or
                  any of the other ways that code can be coupled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We could put code into two categories: ‚Äúleaf code‚Äù, which
                  depends on other code but has no dependencies itself, and
                  ‚Äúbranch code‚Äù, which does have dependencies, and may or may
                  not depend on other code. Branch code incurs tolls and leaf
                  code doesn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                  Good code matters in proportion to future tollway traffic
                </h2>
                <p>
                  When any new piece of code is added to a codebase, it may be
                  possible to predict the future ‚Äútollway traffic‚Äù of that code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Every codebase has some areas that change more frequently than
                  others. If the code you're adding lies in a high-change area,
                  then it's probably safe to predict that that code will have
                  high future tollway traffic. On average it's a good investment
                  to spend time making this code especially good because the
                  upfront effort will get paid back a little bit every time the
                  code gets touched in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Conversely, if there's a piece of code that you have good
                  reason to believe will change infrequently, it's less
                  important to make this code good, because the return on
                  investment won't be as great. (If you find out that your
                  original prediction was wrong, it may be wise to refactor the
                  code so you don't end up paying more in toll fees than you
                  have to.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  If there's a piece of code that's very clearly ‚Äúbranch code‚Äù
                  (other code depends on it) then it's usually a good idea to
                  spend extra time to make sure this code is easily
                  understandable. Most codebases have a small handful of key
                  models which are touched by a large amount of code in the
                  codebase. If the branch code is sound, it's a great benefit.
                  If the branch code has problems (e.g. some fundamental concept
                  was poorly-named early on) then those problems will stretch
                  their tentacles throughout the codebase and cause very
                  expensive problems.
                </p>
                <h2>Bad reasons to write bad code</h2>
                <p>
                  It's commonly believed that it's wise to take on ‚Äústrategic
                  technical debt‚Äù in order to meet deadlines. In theory this is
                  a smart way to go, but in practice it's always a farce. The
                  debt gets incurred but then never paid back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It's also a mistake to write crappy code because ‚Äúusers don't
                  care about code‚Äù. Users obviously don't literally care about
                  code, but users do experience the symptoms of bad code when
                  the product is full of bugs and the development team's
                  productivity slows to a crawl.
